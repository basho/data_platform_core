Data Platform Core
----

Data Platform Core is the additive component to [Riak KV](https://github.com/basho/riak), colloquially called "the Service Manager", that enables Riak to run supervised 3rd party applications on a Riak+BDP cluster. More generally, it can be thought of an application executor and watcher, that provides service configuration meta-data exchange in a distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant method.
